## Setting remote work

To use your Raspberry pi from your computer you can easily access to it through [SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/)

Alternatively and if you want to see the screen to focus the camera for example you can use [Microsoft remote desktop](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-remote-desktop/)

To access the data on you Raspberry pi you can use set a [Samba server](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-samba/)

Alternatively you can use SCP but I could not make it work.
